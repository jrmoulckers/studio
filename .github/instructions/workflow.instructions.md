# Issue-First Development Workflow

Every product change must trace to a GitHub issue and land through a feature branch and PR.

## Default Workflow

1. Verify or create the GitHub issue.
2. Scan for an existing worktree for the issue; resume it if found.
3. Otherwise prefer an app-native isolated project session/worktree from the default branch. If that
   capability is unavailable, require a runtime-provided, explicitly approved location allowed by
   root/scoped authority.
4. Implement scoped changes on a feature branch.
5. Commit as `type(scope): description (#N)`.
6. Run the repo's documented format, lint, type-check, test, and build commands for the affected surface.
7. Fetch and rebase onto the default branch.
8. Push the feature branch and create a PR with `Closes #N`.
9. Verify the PR exists with `gh pr view`.
10. Monitor CI and mergeability until checks are green and the PR is `MERGEABLE`.
11. Self-merge only PRs you authored when the quality gate passes and `AGENTS.md` permits it.
12. Remove the worktree after merge.

Stopping at a local commit is incomplete. A task is done only when the PR is merged, or when a green, mergeable PR clearly documents a `## Needs Human Action` blocker.

## Definition of Done

| Gate | Verification | Pass criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean tree | `git status` | No uncommitted changes. |
| Pushed | `git log origin/<branch>..HEAD` | Empty. |
| PR exists | `gh pr view <branch> --json number` | Returns a PR number. |
| CI green | `gh pr checks <number>` | No failing or pending required checks. |
| Mergeable | `gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` | `MERGEABLE`, not dirty/behind. |
| Issue linked | PR body | `Closes #N` for each resolved issue. |
| Landed | `gh pr view <number> --json state` | `MERGED`, or a documented human-gated blocker. |

## Worktrees

Prefer app-native isolated project sessions/worktrees rather than extra clones. Never invent or
hard-code a sibling worktree path. If app-native isolation is unavailable, the runtime must provide
an explicitly approved worktree location and root/scoped authority must permit it; otherwise stop.

```bash
git worktree list
git worktree add <approved-worktree-path> -b <type>/<short-description>-<issue> origin/<default-branch>
git worktree remove <approved-owned-worktree-path>
```

Record the exact branch, path, and creating session before mutation. Remove only worktrees created
and owned by the current session; never recursively delete a worktree path.

Branch types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`.

## Issue Lifecycle

`Created → PR opened with Closes #N → PR merged → issue auto-closed`.

Rules:

- Do not close issues manually; let linked PRs close them on merge.
- Use `Closes #N` for completed work and `Refs #N` for related context.
- Put each closing reference on its own line in the PR body.

## Validation

Run the product's own commands. Prefer documented scripts over ad hoc tool calls.

Typical coverage:

- Formatter / format check.
- Linter.
- Type-check or static analysis.
- Unit/integration tests for changed behavior.
- Build/package checks for affected apps or packages.

If any check fails, fix it, rerun the relevant checks, create a new scoped commit, and push again.
Amend only when the user explicitly requests it and applicable authority permits it.

## Calling reusable workflows

Studio product repos call the backbone's reusable workflows with
`uses: jrmoulckers/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml@main`.

**A caller `permissions:` block replaces the defaults — it does not add to them.** Every scope you
omit is set to `none`, and a called workflow can never receive more than its caller holds. So a
least-privilege `permissions: { contents: read }` in the caller silently strips the scopes the
reusable workflow declares for itself. The symptom is a bare `startup_failure` with **no readable
log**, which is easy to misdiagnose as a broken `uses:` reference.

Grant every scope the callee declares:

| Reusable workflow | Scopes the caller must grant |
| --- | --- |
| `reusable-ci-lint` | `contents: read` **and `pull-requests: read`** (Semantic PR Title job) |
| `reusable-ci-web` | `contents: read` |
| `reusable-perf-budget` | `contents: read` |
| `reusable-smoke-test` | `contents: read` |
| `reusable-deploy-preview` | `contents: read` (plus whatever your deploy step needs) |

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read      # required by reusable-ci-lint

jobs:
  lint:
    uses: jrmoulckers/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-lint.yml@main
    with:
      package-manager: pnpm
```

Rules:

- Before adding a caller-level `permissions:` block, open the callee and copy its declared scopes.
- Omitting `permissions:` entirely inherits the repo default — safe, but less explicit.
- If a scope truly cannot be granted, disable the job that needs it instead
  (e.g. `semantic-pr-title: false` for `reusable-ci-lint`).
- Debug a `startup_failure` with no log by checking caller permissions first.

### Taking only part of `reusable-ci-lint`

`reusable-ci-lint` carries three independent checks — lint, format-check, and Conventional-Commits
PR title — and each is opt-out, so never inline a local copy of one of them:

- No ESLint/Prettier in the repo? Pass `lint-command: ''` and `format-check-command: ''`. The lint
  job then skips entirely (no checkout, no install) and only the PR-title check runs.
- Have a linter but no formatter (or vice versa)? Empty just the one you lack.
- Can't grant `pull-requests: read`? Pass `semantic-pr-title: false`.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  pr-title:
    uses: jrmoulckers/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-lint.yml@main
    with:
      lint-command: ''
      format-check-command: ''
```

Passing an empty string is the supported opt-out. Leaving a command at its default in a repo that
has no such script fails the job; duplicating backbone logic locally makes the product repo drift
from canon.

### Never vendor a backbone workflow or health file

`workflows` and `health` are **native** kinds: they reach product repos through GitHub itself, not
through the sync engine, which resolves and reports them but never writes a file for them. So a
product repo must contain **no copy of its own**:

- **No `.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml`.** Call the backbone's with
  `uses: jrmoulckers/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml@main`, never
  `uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml`. A vendored copy is a silent fork: upstream fixes never
  reach it and nothing flags the divergence.
- **No `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`,
  `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` or `DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`** unless you are deliberately overriding the studio
  version for that repo. GitHub prefers a repo's own health file over the one inherited from
  `jrmoulckers/.github`, so a verbatim copy overrides the inherited file and freezes it at the day
  it was copied.

In both cases a local copy is **worse than having nothing**, and the sync engine cannot rescue you
— it never writes native kinds, so it can neither update the copy nor report it as drift. If you
find one in a member repo, delete it; that is the whole fix.

Opting in to `health` or `workflows` in `studio.config.json` means *"this member relies on the
backbone's"* — it is a declaration, not an install.

## Merge Conflict Protocol

Treat conflicts with the same urgency as red CI.

Detect every polling cycle:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,headRefName
```

| State | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MERGEABLE` + `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` | Continue monitoring CI. |
| `MERGEABLE` + `BEHIND` | Rebase on the default branch and re-push. |
| `CONFLICTING` or `DIRTY` | Run the auto-resolve cycle. |
| `UNKNOWN` | Wait briefly and re-poll. |

Auto-resolve only mechanical conflicts you understand: whitespace, import order, regenerated files, changelog ordering, or lockfiles recreated by the repo's package manager. Escalate semantic conflicts such as same-function edits, schema changes, security-sensitive logic, or incompatible refactors.

Use `git push --force-with-lease` only after a rebase on your own PR branch. Never use plain `git push --force`.

## Fleet Coordination

For parallel sprint work:

1. Query issues and PRs.
2. Resolve applicable roles from root/scoped `AGENTS.md`, consumer `.github/instructions/`, and
   declared local routing. A discovered `.github/agents/` file alone does not authorize dispatch;
   exclude disabled, handoff-only, read-only, and out-of-scope roles.
3. Track assignments in SQL todos.
4. Batch small related issues only when they touch the same files and keep the PR under reviewable size.
5. Publish a merge order for dependent PRs.
6. Re-dispatch failed or incomplete agents until every PR is green and mergeable.
